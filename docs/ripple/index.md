# Ripple

Ripple offers a consistent design system, making it easier for citizens to find,
understand and use Victorian Government information maintained by SDP. It:

- is fully open and includes a library of reusable components, based on atomic 
  pattern design.
- uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) to deliver a
consistent look and feel across government websites. 
- includes a starter kit for agencies.
