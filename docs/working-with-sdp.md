## Before you start

Welcome to the Single Digital Presence (SDP). Before you start working
with the DPC team there are a few tasks to complete.

- Request access to JIRA
    
    For issues needing more than a quick helping hand, having access to JIRA
    will allow you to raise tickets with the SDP team in [JIRA Service Desk](https://support.sdp.vic.gov.au/).

- Request access to Slack, Lagoon and GitHub

    Now that you can create tickets in JIRA Service Desk, send us a ticket with name, email and GitHub handle
    and ask for access to the following:

    - The [Lagoon Dashboard](https://dashboard.amazeeio.cloud/projects/) allows you to check the status of your
    builds in Lagoon.
    - DPC uses Slack for ad-hoc help. Ask for help here, but if it is complex we will probably get you to raise a
    ticket.
    - There are GitHub repositories for both the front-end and back-end applications that you will be working on.

## Setup key in the Lagoon Dashboard

Once you have access to the [Lagoon Dashboard](https://dashboard.amazeeio.cloud/projects/) make sure to add your
key at https://dashboard.amazeeio.cloud/settings. This will be required for a local build so you can pull down a
copy of the production database!

## Build Tide and Ripple

You're now ready to build projects locally. There are instructions in the `README.md` files of each project.
