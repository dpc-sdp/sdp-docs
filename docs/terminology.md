# Terminology

## Atomic design

Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five
distinct levels in atomic design:

- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms
- Templates
- Pages

## API
Application Programming Interface (API) is a mechanism to allow applications to 
communicate with one another. An API is not a database. It is an access point to 
an app that can access a database.

## Bay
[Bay](../bay) is a fully managed platform and hosting environment that provides an open
Platform as a Service model managed by SDP. It:
- is an open-source hosting platform based on Lagoon.
- allows agencies to build, test and deliver websites via the cloud.

## Component
A UI pattern library is simply a place where all of these components live
together. UI pattern libraries can be part of a wider design system.

## Content Repository
Database of digital content with an associated set of data management, search
and access methods allowing application-independent access to the content,
rather like a digital library, but with the ability to store and modify content
in addition to searching and retrieving. It provides an API for clients 
(frontend websites, mobile applications, etc.) to interact with content. 

## Drupal
[Drupal](https://www.drupalorg) is free, open source software that can be used 
by individuals or groups of users to easily create and manage many types of Web 
sites. The application includes a content management platform and a development 
framework.

## Frontend Website
A website built with front-end and server rendering technologies connected to 
the Content Repository.  

## Git
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a distributed version-control system
for tracking changes in source code during software development.It is designed
for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in
any set of files.

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a [Git](#Git) repository hosting service, but it
adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides
a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several
collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for
every project.

## Nuxt
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) is a framework that helps to build server-rendered
[Vue.js](#vuejs) applications easily. It abstracts most of the complex
configuration involved in managing things like asynchronous data, middleware,
and routing. It's similar to Angular Universal for Angular, and Next.js for
React.

## Pull-request, PR
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub
repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set
of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if
necessary.

## Ripple
[Ripple](../ripple) offers a consistent design system, making it easier for citizens to find,
understand and use Victorian Government information maintained by SDP. It:
- is fully open and includes a library of reusable components, based on atomic 
  pattern design.
- uses Vue.js and Nuxt to deliver a consistent look and feel across government 
websites. 
- includes a starter kit for agencies.

## SDP
Single Digital Presence is an open, flexible technical solution that
government agencies can use to reduce the cost and effort of digital
development.

## Style guide
Front-end application to demonstrate components of the Ripple Pattern Library.

## Storybook
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) software that powers [style guide](#style guide).

## Tide
[Tide](../tide) is an API first, headless content management system using Drupal 8 and 
maintained by SDP. 

Custom built to meet Victorian Government requirements, it offers:
- multi-site content distribution
- pick and mix features
- centralised feature governance

## Vue.js 
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive framework for building user
interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground
up to be incrementally adoptable.
