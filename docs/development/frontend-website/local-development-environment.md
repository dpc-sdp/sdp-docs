## Vue.js tools setup 

The steps below describe how to setup IDE (PHPStorm/WebStorm) to work with 
Vue.js application.

### Setup JS version

### Setup JS Debugging
1. Create a new JavaScript debug configuration
2. Specify the URL the app is running on (http://localhost:8000)
3. Set a breakpoint 
4. Start the debug session by pressing "Debug" button in WebStorm/PHPStorm.

Once the code where the breakpoint is has been triggered, the execution will
stop, and youâ€™ll see the local and global variables, the call stack, and many
other things in the IDE debug tools window.
