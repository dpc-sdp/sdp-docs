# Tide

Tide is an API first, headless content management system using Drupal 8 and 
maintained by SDP. 

Custom built to meet Victorian Government requirements, it offers:

- multi-site content distribution
- pick and mix features
- centralised feature governance

The profile is a mere collection of Tide modules bundled into governed,
stable and tested Drupal installation profile.

All modules and a profile have automated tests to guarantee that a set of all
modules at specified versions is always stable.
