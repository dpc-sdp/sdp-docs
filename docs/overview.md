# Overview

SDP project covers implementing a Drupal distribution to build a Content 
Repository containing site sections and providing content for Frontend Websites. 
It also covers providing of technical implementation to build fully independent 
sites.

!!! info

    Example of Content Repository is https://vic.gov.au, which has site-sections 
    such as Aboriginal Victoria or Family Violence.
    
    Semi-independent sites are the other sites that have their content centrally 
    managed. An example of such site is the Office of the Victorian Government 
    Architect site.
    
    Fully independent sites are completely separate installations of the whole 
    distribution.
