# Overview

SDP project covers implementing a Drupal distribution to build a content 
repository containing site sections and providing content for frontend websites. 
It also provides of technical implementation to build fully independent 
sites.

!!! info

    Example of content repository is https://vic.gov.au, which has site-sections 
    such as Aboriginal Victoria or Family Violence.
    
    Semi-independent sites are the other sites that have their content centrally 
    managed. An example of such a site is the Office of the Victorian Government 
    Architect site.
    
    Fully independent sites are completely separate installations of the whole 
    distribution.
